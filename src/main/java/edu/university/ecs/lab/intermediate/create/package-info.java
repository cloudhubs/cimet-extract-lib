/**
 * This package contains the classes responsible for creating the intermediate representation (IR) from remote repositories.
 *
 * <p>This package involves using the {@link edu.university.ecs.lab.intermediate.create.services.IRExtractionService}
 * to clone repositories, scan them for REST endpoints and calls, and then write the extracted data to an intermediate representation file.
 * {@link edu.university.ecs.lab.intermediate.create.IRExtractionRunner} is available as a test runner.</p>
